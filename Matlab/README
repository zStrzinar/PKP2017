1. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is Matlab-coder-friendly rewrite of the algorithm for sea edge detector
and segmentation from [1,2]. To compile with the coder, replacement functions are needed.
If you are interested in Matlab-coder-compatible port that translates to C++, please contact
Rok Mandeljc, who implemented coder-compatible wrappers for some functions.
